e.printStackTraces() errors 
    -> Our highest priority was to fix our stack print errors that we have in our code. To fix this we are going to
    implement a dialog box that tells the user there's an error. In addition, the user will have the ability to 
    browse for a new file.
    
SimData Magic Number errors
    -> This was a fairly straightforward resolution, gave specific final names to the index values for the constructor
    to access the proper xml tags.
    
SimData Cleanliness
    -> Commented out all of the unused methods (to this point) and reduced the constructor by removing inputting a 
    method that was just going to be a method call regardless.
